The all-in-one pet lover's app that's changing the way you connect with other pets! Whether you're looking to adopt, find the perfect breeding match, or need a trustworthy pet sitter.

#What it does : 

PupPlanner is a comprehensive pet-oriented platform that offers three core features:

Animal Adoption: PupPlanner allows users to browse and connect with pets available for adoption at local shelters and organizations. With a Tinder-like swiping interface, users can find their perfect furry companion and access the contact information of the pet's shelter or organization.

Animal Breeding: Our app facilitates responsible pet breeding by connecting pet owners interested in breeding their pets. Users can search for compatible breeding partners, initiate conversations with other pet owners, and arrange breeding sessions.

Pet Sitting: PupPlanner provides a directory of trusted pet sitters, both individuals and organizations. Busy pet owners can find and hire reliable pet sitters to ensure their pets receive the care and exercise they need.
